# SlotMachine
This program uses Random to simulate a slot machine, which is a gambling device where the user inserts money into and then pulls a lever (or presses a button). The slot machine then displays a set of random images. If two or more of the images matches, the user wins an amount of money that the slot machine dispenses back to the user.
